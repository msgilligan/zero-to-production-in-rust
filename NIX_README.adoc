This is a work in progress.

== Building with Cargo and Nix Develop

. `cd` into the project directory
. `$ nix develop`
. `[devshell]$ cargo build`

`cargo run` and `cargo test` should also work.

NOTE:: The current goal is to be able to do a build in a shell configured by `nix develop` on either Linux or macOS. In the future we hope to have a full support for a flake-based build.
